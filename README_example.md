<h1 align="center">Hirst Dot Painting</h1>

I was tasked to create a Hirst Dot Painting in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day eighteen of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-OOP

<h2>What I learned</h2>
This is my second day of being introduced to the concept of OOP. I think I am getting a grasp of it. I am sure this is just reiterating what you all know but the reinforcement will help me. Objects are created from blueprints, or classes. Then objects can be modified indivdualy or globally via attributes. Objects also have actions, or functions that they can do. I think this is the simplest way to put it. I have enjoyed exploring OOP and using modules.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
I see now that this is how I can better organize my code. Now there is no reason to have functions upon functions defined within main.py.
